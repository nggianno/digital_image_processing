# digital_image_processing

(Electrical Engineering School AUTH) In this lesson we were given 3 exercises to implement in MATLAB in order to learn the usability of filtering an image both in frequency and in space. We also created Gaussian and Butterworth filters and applied them in images and we got familiar with the idea of spectral clustering and K-means algorithm.
